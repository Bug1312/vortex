# Vortex - A TARDIS Mod in the Making

A temporary repository for my [BlanketCon '25](https://modfest.net/bc25) submition showcasing some of my recent work on my representation of what I'd like in a TARDIS in Minecraft.

Expect messier than usual code, strange debug lines, weird comments, and none of my gradle setup! :D

I've had to rip out a bunch of things that were 90% finished but not ready to showcase. 
I also expected I could keep my source closed until seeing the booth rules arrived on March 1st. 

pls no judg :)

Once I'm actually finished with a MVP I'll release this mod under LGPLv3.0 and it will much be cleaner. Until then this is All Rights Reserved.
